# Singular Value Decomposition

It is another form of factorization for the matrix $A$. It is decomposition that factorizes any matrix to 2 orthogonal matrices and a diagonal matrix. If $A$ were symmetric postive definite, then the SVD gives us the eigenvector matrix and the eigen value diagonal matrix.
